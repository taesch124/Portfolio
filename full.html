I have developed interfaces to allow for Federal reporting of the assets and well as interfaces to allow customer trades executed with PNC to be captured in CIT systems. I am also currently learning Web Development through a Rutgers sponsored program.</p>
                        <p class="bio">&emsp;After graduating school in 2014 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Southern California, I moved back home and began to learn computer programming on my own. I took a 4 month course to learn Unix, SQL, and Java and then got hired to work fot CIT. I would like to work on programming solutions to make user's lives easier while remaining simple and engaging to use.</p>
